ImageUpload
===========

ImageUpload is an IE Plugin that makes uploading images from digital cameras faster and easier. Originally, it was created when IE was the only serious browser AND the primary interface between digital cameras and PCs was proprietary serial port interfaces. Later, support for standard USB DCIM was added. When dial-up modems were the primary way to connect to the Internet, automatic resizing and cropping of photos before upload was a huge speedup. In modern times, fewer people use IE and even fewer will install binary Plugins. Everybody has a high speed connetion and it is possible to do resizing and cropping in client side JavaScript.
